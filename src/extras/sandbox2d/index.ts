 *
 * Contains legacy 2D simulation components:
 * - Robot: 2D robot representation
 * - Obstacle: 2D obstacles
 * - LiDAR: 2D LiDAR simulation
 * - OccupancyGrid: 2D occupancy grids
 *
 * Note: For ISAC research, use 3D UAV components in models/robotics instead.
 * This module is kept for educational/prototyping purposes.
